# Breaking-Into-Toronto-Bicycle-Thefts

### Introduction
Torontoâ€™s biking culture has been growing steadily over the past few years, with more people opting for sustainable travel. However, between 2014 and 2019, over 21,000 bike thefts were reported in the city. The current bike safety measures appear insufficient in protecting bikes and their owners. This analysis aims to investigate how these measures could be improved to target the areas and populations most affected by bike thefts.

By examining various aspects of bike theft in Toronto, we hope to better understand when and where security needs to be increased, and which types of bikes are more likely to be stolen. We focus on the 10 neighbourhoods that accounted for almost 50% of the reported bike thefts from 2014 to 2019.

Key Insights
High-Risk Areas: 10 neighbourhoods in Toronto contributed to almost 50% of all bike theft incidents. These neighbourhoods are mainly located in the downtown core.

Premise Types: Most thefts occur from bikes left outside in open areas such as streets, parking lots, and other public spaces. Neighbourhood geography, such as proximity to educational institutions or residential areas, plays a significant role in the theft distribution.

Time of Theft: The number of bike thefts peaks during warmer months (May to October) and typically occurs during the afternoon and late night when fewer people are around.

Bike Features: Certain bike colours (such as black) and types (such as regular bikes and mountain bikes) appear to be more commonly stolen, but this may be due to their higher availability in these neighbourhoods.

Data Analysis
The data was collected from the Toronto Police Service Public Safety Data Portal, which includes information on bike theft incidents across 140 neighbourhoods in Toronto. The analysis focuses on:

The neighbourhoods with the highest number of bike thefts.

The most common types of premises (e.g., apartment, house, commercial area) from which bikes are stolen.

The time of day and year when thefts are most likely to occur.

The types and colours of bikes most frequently stolen.

Visualizations
The following key visualizations have been included:

Top 10 Neighbourhoods by Theft Incidents: A bar chart showing the number of bike thefts in each of the top 10 neighbourhoods.

Bike Theft by Premise Type: A pie chart illustrating the proportion of thefts from different types of premises.

Monthly and Yearly Trends: Line charts showing bike theft trends over time.

Hourly Trends: Heatmaps showing the time of day when bike thefts are most likely to occur.

Bike Features: Proportions of bike thefts by bike colour and type.

Conclusion
Our analysis suggests that bike thefts in Toronto are most concentrated in the downtown core, where bikes are more prevalent. We recommend increasing surveillance in these areas and improving security measures. In particular, bike owners should be alerted to the risks of leaving bikes outside. The warmer months, especially the late-night hours, also appear to be when bike thefts are most likely to occur, making these times a priority for increased security.
